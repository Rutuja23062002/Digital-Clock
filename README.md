ðŸ•’ Digital Clock using PIC18F4520 & DS1307 RTC
This project demonstrates a real-time digital clock built using the PIC18F4520 microcontroller interfaced with the DS1307 RTC module via I2C communication. The system reads the current time and date from the RTC and displays it on a 16x2 LCD. It also includes UART functionality to receive and set time from a PC serial terminal and external interrupt support to trigger updates. The project showcases peripheral initialization, interrupt handling, and real-time data display in embedded systems using MPLAB and XC8.

Key Features:

I2C communication with DS1307 RTC

LCD interface for time & date display

UART-based time setting from serial terminal

External interrupt support

Written in Embedded C using MPLAB & XC8
